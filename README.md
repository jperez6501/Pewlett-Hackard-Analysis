### Furthermore, lets break down these numbers by department. Below you will see two tables, the first tables is of the employees that are getting ready to retire by department. The table below that shows the number of employees broken down by departments that are elgible for the mentorship program. Lets take a look at one department, Senior Engineer. Almost 25000 employees will be retiring but there is only about 400 employees that will be eligible to particate in the mentorship program. That means that one Senior Engineer employee participating in the mentorship program will be responsible to mentor at least 62 incoming new Senior Engineer Employess. This is not nearly enough. 
### Now lets look at the Manager Department, while only 2 Managers are set to retire, there is no Manangers eligible to participate in the mentorship program. That means that there is no Manangers to train the new hires.

### In total, 72458 employees are getting ready to retire. That means that if the company is looking at maintaining staffing numbers close to what they have now, this is the number of new hires that will be required. The problem that now presents itsel is that there is only 1549 current employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, not nearly enough to train the new hires.
